_MIGHT_ is a personal project I have been working on for over 20 years.
The objective has been to write a story about a youth-led revolution that actually changes the world for the better.
The only other criterion I have stuck to all along is that it must _convince me_.

This has been problematic.
The truth is, in about 25 years of studying revolution and social change, I found mostly obstacles to a truly grassroots, democratic, largely nonviolent revolution.
Paths to such a change were not forthcoming.
The problems with revolution are so paradoxical, virtually nobody studies it as anything but a historical phenomenon that creates messes.

Nevertheless, I believe my life's work is to tell this story, so I never stopped looking.

Having been writing about _youth liberation_ since 1994, I have long believed that the only class in society with revolutionary is youth.
The class with the most future to live, representing a far broader demographic cross-section of that future, is the only one likely to set up a future suitable for _all_ classes.
No other group in society -- certainly not the Left's beloved working class -- has nearly the potential to institute truly radical change; not in the US, anyway.
Every other group's ship has sailed.

There have long been four major problems with the notion of a directly democratic, youth-led revolution.
The first problem faces _all_ revolutionary classes: how to meet and make decisions when the enemy can crush you if you stick your head up.
Historically, revolutionaries have formed clandestine committees for effectiveness.
This centralization necessitates hierarchy and has reliably led to elitism and authoritiarianism.

The second problem is that youth have no power.
They are arguably the weakest class of significant size in all society, legally depending on the opposite class for nearly all rights, privileges, and power.
There is no theory for revolution by the powerless.

Furthermore, youth are not a recognized class.
Class consciousness is required in order for two-sided class conflict.
The oppression of young people has virtually no organized resistance, let alone a vision of an alternate future.
Even in a novel, it is very difficult to contrive an entire movement among people who do not even consider themselves a class with shared interests.

Finally, even if youth could self-define as a class and could meet and plan democratically, and even if they somehow attained leverage in society, revolution is a brutal undertaking.
Without violence, it requires tremendous exposure and coordination.

From 1999 to 2015, I worked on draft after draft of idea after idea for _Might_ (the title has remained th same).
A second book, _Will_, was slated to be "an oral history of the revolution"; _Might_ itself would make lots of contextual references to the revolutionary phase, but it was mostly a political thriller set in "mixtopia" -- a revolutionary society that still had lots of problems.
The original work was set in 2035, when a new generation of activists was arriving at adolescence shortly _after_ a youth-led revolution.
It is much easier for me to envision a better world that is truly realistic and functional than it is to tell how we would get there.
The original timeline for 2000 to 2015 included:

1. a massive upsurge in anti-neoliberal organizing in 2000 (led by the Zapatistas of Mexico, not white folks in the US)
2. a rogue nation terror attack in 2001 on the US that led to a new wave of US wars (I dind't say Al Qaeda)
3. a massive financial collapse in 2015 due to personal debt

Points 1 and 2 involved a steadily strengthening Left, with youth liberation as a core component along with all the other Left priorities.
Youth would eat away at notions of "left" vs "right" and decide that anyone interested in the "Old" system was simply "looking bacward" (yes, homage to Edward Bellamy).

But even with this broader movement I had in mind for years -- while I was _heavily_ participating in the US Left at the time, as an organizer, writer, orator, and street medic -- I became increasingly convinced that the US Left is not a suitable vehicle for revolution, and that it never would be.

This was beyond depressing.
Having spent 5 years in the nascent and now evaporated "youth liberation movement", I saw examples of sophisticated leadership and idealism tempered by wisdom, including the wisdom of elders, who were always consulted.

Unfortunately, most elders were extraordinarily problematic allies.
They were dismissive of our ideas, and their ideas were steeped in old thinking.
They were sexist, racist, homophobic and transphobic, and they exhibited it.
They also had typical adult attitudes toward kids; being leftist had seeminly zero impact on most people's view of youth.
Ironically given the reputation of the 1960s, the Left seemed as anti-kid as the rest of society.

When I turned 25 myself, I still believed in revolution, and I knew it could be led by youth.
For years more, I wrote and spoke about the need for a youth-led revolutionary movement; I longed to support such an effort, as I still do.
Then I got old and tired.
My work on _Might_ dragged after I spent time observing a real resistance movement up front and witnessing the utter cruelty of oppression firsthand, as a medic in Palestine.
Palestinians struggle with a fervor I simply could not imagine in the United States, and they were still so easily beaten everywhere I turned.
There was no convincing myself of the revolutionary potential of anyone in the United States.
_Might_ was drowning.

Tired of waiting for the world to come around to my anarchist ways, I spent my 30s trying to form organizations that could "prefiguratively" model the world I hoped to portray in _Might_.
I started with an anti-commercial, nonprofit news organization, The NewStandard.
I am proud of the work we did there, publishing nearly 3,000 articles over 3.5 years, and paying for all of them.

Next I tried a startup in New York City, an attempt to build a flat company to run a health and fitness social network.
I got into the room with lots of capitalists eager to fund such a project, but they could tell I was not one of them.

Something changed in 2015, around the time I was maing my eighth or so career change.
I was managing technical documentation at a Big Data startup when it struck me that the tools we were using to document software in a versioned manner would make it possible to write laws and policies in radically collaborative ways.

Around the same time, I started reading about the technology behind Bitcoin, just because I was fascinated.
I had long understood the basic principles of distributed computing, and I even recall assuming that a radically distributed network would someday be used to run a democratially planned socialist economy.

What had never occurred to me before Satoshi Nakamoto released that first blockchain application that I considered we might be able to use distributed tech to coordinate life _before and during_ revolution, not just after.
And really not even then until someone started pointing out it's not just good for cryptocurrency, even if less than 1% of blockchain visionaries are looking at other applications.

This was all quite consistent with my own beliefs on revolutionary strategy, which insists on a _grassroots dual power_ phase, during which the revolutionary movement forms real infrastructure in the shadow of the old society.
Despite calling myself a technologist from time to time on my resume, 
 
The novel is called _Might_, and the fictional author's memoir that makes up the entire book is called _Will_.
This is because I believe the stories in the book are plausible: they _might_ happen, if we have the _will_ to make the necessary changes.
