  content: MIGHT _follows Apricity Carter, Grover Parsons, and the rest of Cell\[0\]
    as they build a youth movement that threatens the American adultocracy. After
    disarming their closest adversaries and forming a nonviolent army, youth use democratizing
    technology to organize against and eventually replace the dominant system, designed
    to devour their planet, their freedom, and their future. The establishment might
    be slow to catch on to the ZeroBloc movement and its distributed clandestine command
    and control technology, but you know they won't take revolution standing down.
    Written as Grover's memoir in 2046,_ MIGHT _looks back on a quarter century of
    revolution and reveals how they pulled off the Reboot amidst the inherent tragedy
    of social struggle on a warming, shrinking planet._
